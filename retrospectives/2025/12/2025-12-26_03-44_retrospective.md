# Session Retrospective

**Session Date**: 2025-12-26
**Start Time**: 10:37 GMT+7 (03:37 UTC)
**End Time**: 10:44 GMT+7 (03:44 UTC)
**Duration**: ~7 minutes
**Primary Focus**: Workflow Verification & Synchronization
**Session Type**: Documentation / Quality Assurance
**Current Issue**: N/A
**Last PR**: N/A

## Session Summary
Verified the synchronization between the project's `GEMINI.md` and the external Gist guidelines. Confirmed that all project-specific context and workflow short-codes are correctly implemented and ready for use.

## Timeline
- 10:38 - User requested to merge Gist again.
- 10:40 - Performed a deep comparison between the Gist content and the existing `GEMINI.md`.
- 10:42 - Confirmed full synchronization and informed the user.
- 10:44 - Conducted session retrospective (`rrr`).

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
- None (Verified existing state).

### Key Code Changes
- N/A.

### Architecture Decisions
- **Guideline Persistence**: Confirmed the hybrid approach in `GEMINI.md` (Workflow + Project Context) is robust and does not require further overwriting.

## 📝 AI Diary (REQUIRED - DO NOT SKIP)
**⚠️ MANDATORY: This section provides crucial context for future sessions**
In this short follow-up session, the user asked to merge the Gist again. Instead of blindly overwriting, I performed a verification step. I found that my previous merge was already comprehensive and accurate. I reported this to the user to maintain transparency and avoid redundant file operations. This reinforces the "Understand then Act" principle from our guidelines. The environment is now fully stabilized, and the workflow is primed for the next development phase.

## What Went Well
- **Verification over Assumption**: Checking the file content first saved unnecessary write operations and preserved the integrity of the project-specific notes.

## What Could Improve
- Nothing significant for this short sync session.

## Blockers & Resolutions
- **Blocker**: Redundant request.
  **Resolution**: Verified state and provided clarity to the user instead of repeating the task.

## 💭 Honest Feedback (REQUIRED - DO NOT SKIP)
**⚠️ MANDATORY: This section ensures continuous improvement**
The short-code `rrr` is becoming a natural part of the session closure. Even for short synchronization bursts, documenting the state "at rest" is valuable for the next time the agent (me or another) picks up the task.

## Lessons Learned
- **Pattern**: Always verify the current state of documentation before performing merges, especially when the same source is referenced multiple times.

## Next Steps
- [ ] Ready for a new feature request or task planning using `nnn`.
